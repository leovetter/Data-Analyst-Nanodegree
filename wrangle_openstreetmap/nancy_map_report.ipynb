    "#### a) Names misspelled\n",
    "\n",
    "The major problem I encountered was that different names was used for the same city or the same street. For instance the city \"Vandoeuvre-lès-Nancy\" had these four differents spellings :\n",
    "* Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy\n",
    "* Vandoeuvre-lès-Nancy\n",
    "* Vandœuvre-lès-Nancy\n",
    "* Vandoeuvre les Nancy\n",

    "So I made sure to update these names to an common name before inserting them into mongodb. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### b) Street names not capitalized\n",
    "\n",
    "Some street name were starting with a lower letter and others with upper letters so I updated them programatically with the `capitalize` python function before inserting them into mongodb.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### c) Postal codes not corresponding to Nancy\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple query `db.nodes.distinct('address.postcode', {})` show that postal code have all a correct format but does not correspond all to the postal code of Nancy. After it appears that the data concern not only the city of Nancy but also the suburban area. Below is a count of the node for each postal code :\n",
